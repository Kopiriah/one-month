<p title="remember how i called you that for weeks">
dear beloved,

<p>
how time flies.
</p>

<p title="it's true, but also nica pointed out that we just have to celebrate for reaching one month lmao">
would it be cheesy to say that i‚Äôve been counting the days we‚Äôve been together?
</p>

<p title="i still remember how i sat in my dark ass room bcos i was too immersed in our conversation wahsjhds">
it‚Äôs already been a month since my phone died an entire day before i got to reply to your confession with my own. a month has passed since i‚Äôve been yours.
</p>

<p title="is it still to early to say i love you?">
knowing your grief, stress, anger, and pain ‚Äî it never fails to astound me how beautiful your heart can be. you‚Äôve given me moments of happiness and comfort that i‚Äôll treasure for the rest of our lives intertwined.
</p>

<p title="i love you.">
one month is all it took to realize how blessed i am to have you. for that, i‚Äôll always be grateful.
</p>

<p title="i love you, ari.">
happy 1 month to us, aking sinta. i think i‚Äôll enjoy loving you for the rest of forever.
